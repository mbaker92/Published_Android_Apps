<h4> Description</h4>
<p>Fee Calculator is an application made in Android Studio that will help users calculate eBay fees. Fee Calculator supports eBay sellers located in the US, Canada, and the UK. They can be Store subscribers or individuals. The application will use the eBay fee table associated with their location, store subscription status, and their seller status (Top Rated or Below Standard) to calculate the profit and eBay fee. Fee Calculator is helpful in determining the potential profit of an item that the user might want to sell. The calculated number will not be exact until the user knows the sales tax percentage of the buyer location since eBay takes their fee from total amount the buyer paid.</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p> QES Pavement Management is an Android application made using Xamarin in Visual Studio that helps pavement condition surveyors gather data in the field. A geojson file is imported from AWS and is used to create a project that contains the sections that need to be surveyed. The user can select different rating standards associated with that project or they can create their own form upon project creation. An offline .mbtiles map is downloaded from AWS and used with <a href="https://github.com/Mapsui/Mapsui">MAPSUI</a> to show the user's current position and the pavement sections using multiple colors. To gather data, the surveyor adds a sample to the list and selects a section by tapping on it on the map. They will then go to the rating screen to gather the data for that section. The section turns green when all required samples are gathered for that section. At the end of the work day, the surveyors will upload the data and photos they gathered to AWS. The tablets are sync'd upon upload so other surveyor's work will now be displayed on their tablet. They can also just sync their tablet if they are not ready to upload the data yet.
