<h4> Description</h4>
<p>Fee Calculator is an application that will help users calculate eBay fees. Fee Calculator supports eBay sellers located in the US, Canada, and the UK. They can be Store subscribers or individuals. The application will use the eBay fee table associated with their location, store subscription status, and their seller status (Top Rated or Below Standard) to calculate the profit and eBay fee. Fee Calculator is helpful in determining the potential profit of an item that the user might want to sell. The calculated number will not be exact until the user knows the sales tax percentage of the buyer location since eBay takes their fee from total amount the buyer paid.</p>
